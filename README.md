# Statistical-Analysis-of-Gymnasium-
This project was a class based project and a part of Probability and Statistics course. 
We were given set of instructions to work on any idea where you can improve something using statistical thinking and
we choose to look at Gymnasium and think about numbers involved in running it. 
Timing was most important as it was an uncontrolable factor. We observed the equipments and saw we can analyze the usage and number of people using the gym at that point of time. This gave us some initial numbers to play with and we successfully submitted the project.
